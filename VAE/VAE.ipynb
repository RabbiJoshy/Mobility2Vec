    "# How We Handled the Target\n",
    "If you look at the above code, you'll see what we did to handle the target variable. We just set it to the majority class before inputting into the model - this gives us a test-agnostic way to encode our inputs for the classifier.<br><br>\n",
    "Of course, the best way to deal with this is to omit the target from your autoencoder training in the first place, but this serves as an example of how we can get around the issue if we want to predict a variable that our autoencoder is expecting.\n",

    "# Anomaly Detection\n",
    "Another great application of DAE is anomaly detection. Here's an intuition on how this works:<br><br>\n",
    "If we input a regular example, unaltered, into the DAE, we expect it to output a strong prediction for the input values. However, if the model sees an \"unusual\" example, it's going to be less certain. It may even return a strong prediction for different values than the input.<br><br>\n",
    "We can measure this uncertainty as the loss against the input example against the model output. This value can be interpreted as an anomaly score.<br><br>\n",
